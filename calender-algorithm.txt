create an array for each category (item, date
submit is pressed
	for dates, submit as "31/12/1998" (https://www.javatpoint.com/java-string-to-date)
		date of order
		date of arrival
		need todays date - https://stackabuse.com/how-to-get-current-date-and-time-in-java/

		OR

		days to arrive (easier way, but assumes that all orders were made on same date)

	store each item in appropriate array (to be used later)



when calender is pressed
	get each date and convert to actual date
		save in array diffDates
	subtract each date from todays date - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13037654/subtract-two-dates-in-java
		store each difference into an array diffDatesSorted (low to high)


	sort diffDates - https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-sort-an-ArrayList-of-dates-based-on-the-current-date-in-Java
	for when each diffDatesSorted aligns with date in diffDates (original array) *** (loop within a loop)
		place corresponding item on screen
		place "x" many days until arrival
